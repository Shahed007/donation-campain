# 3 Features of my projects

* Implemented search function, user can search category wise. If the user's search text does not match, the search data note found page will show. Even if you click on the search button, the data will be displayed, if you click on the enter button, the data will also be displayed. If the user leaves the search box empty, all the data will be displayed.

From there, if the user clicks on the Donate button, the donation page will show the user's donation.
